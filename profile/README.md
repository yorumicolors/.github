**Yorumi** – a calming deep sea colorscheme for developers. 
Inspired by the tranquil night sea, Yorumi bathes your editor in a soothing blend of blues and greens, 
maintaining mellow vibes with low contrast between components. Your text stays razor-sharp and easy on the eyes (~8:1 contrast ratio), 
perfect for late-night coding marathons or when you crave a cozy nook. Less eye strain, more code magic. 
Dive into the soothing world of Yorumi and keep your coding cool.


As a longtime fan of the [Kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) theme by [rebelot](https://github.com/rebelot), 
I wanted to elevate the experience further. Yorumi offers a darker and cozier aesthetic, perfect for maintaining a sharp and serene coding environment.
